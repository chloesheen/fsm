Finite State Machine and Hidden Markov Models

Classes for FSA objects and FST objects that demonstrates understanding based on the procedure in which the FSA accepts
strings of a’s and b’s with an even number of b’s, and the FST changes the first ‘a’ in the string to an ‘e’.

Class for HMM demonstrates understanding of the Viterbi algorithm to determine highest probability based on a sequence of 
observations using HMMs.
